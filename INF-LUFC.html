	*When LUFC defender presses forward, win ball back, CAPO FW makes diagonal run into the space the defender left, send through ball to FW

	*Long Pass to our forward (to feet), short back pass to mid, give-go to forward on the break (well weighted pass into the space)

		successful play, but risky, pressed CM	https://youtu.be/FwGN1njoN5w?t=559
		*Stoppers don't let CAPO Center Defender get  1v1	https://youtu.be/FwGN1njoN5w?t=194
			
Free kicks			
	*QUICK RESTART: they usually stand in front, but sometimes they dont, defense not facing…		
		sample	https://youtu.be/FwGN1njoN5w?t=1200
		sample, professional foul, quick restart would work	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwGN1njoN5w
		sample, two fouls, too slow	https://youtu.be/FwGN1njoN5w?t=1954
		LUFC fast restart	https://youtu.be/FwGN1njoN5w?t=2974
			
	3-5-2 vs 4-3-3	inferno wingers pinch in	
	i would expect a forward to drop (false 9) to create 3-5-2 vs 4-4-2		when we don’t have ball, one stopper picks up CF
